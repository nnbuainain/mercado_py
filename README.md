# mercado_py

A simple python program developed with the purpose of practising POO, error treatment and code modularization. 

The program simulates a simple market where the user can register, add products to cart and finish the purchase.

This is one of the final projects required to complete the course Programação em Python do básico ao avançado - Geek University,
which I highly recommend for Portugues speakers that want to get started (and to get deep) in Python.
